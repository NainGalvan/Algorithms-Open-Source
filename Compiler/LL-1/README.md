# LL-1-Parser

# STEPS TO USE THE PARSER:

● Insert the desired Grammar rules in file input.txt.

● Insert an input string of the form (a+b*9) into Lexinp.txt.

● First run the program lexer.l (Lexical Analyser) to convert the input string
into tokenised form.

● Finally run the program LL1.cpp to see if your input string is correct
according to the Grammar.
